### Weather Sensing Wizard's Hat {#weather-sensing-wizards-hat}

A wearable device that monitors wind, UV index, humidity, and temperature.

**Pros**:  
- Wearable  
- Less distracting than a drone  

**Cons**:  
- Bulky  
- Difficult communication with the user  

### Detachable Wizard's Orb {#detachable-wizards-orb}

An orb with sensors for temperature, UV, and humidity that can be detached for flexible use.

**Pros**:  
- Easy to use  
- Comprehensive display  

**Cons**:  
- Display implementation could be challenging  
- Durability concerns due to modularity
