## **Mission Statement** {#mission-statement}

Our mission is to innovate the hiking experience by merging functionality with imagination. By creating a technologically advanced staff inspired by the timeless wizard's tool, we aim to empower outdoor enthusiasts with real-time environmental data and navigational insights. Our project demonstrates that practicality and creativity can coexist, paving the way for a new generation of products that are as useful as they are inspiring. We strive to enhance safety, awareness, and adventure for hikers while pushing the boundaries of what everyday objects can achieve in the modern world.

## **Communication Channels and Procedures** {#communication-channels-and-procedures}

| Name | 1st Pref Comms | 2nd Pref Comms | 3rd Pref Comms |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Gwen Eging | Discord: gubb\_gubb | Email: geging@asu.edu |
| Houyu Zhang | Discord: alpaca\_z | Email: hzhan322@asu.edu |
| Mudit Lal | Discord: muditlal | Email: mlal4@asu.edu |
| SeanMichael Hall | Discord: seanmikeall | email: shall58@asu.edu |

Our team’s primary method of communication is through Discord, with text messages as a backup. These methods can be asynchronous, which is excellent for assigning parts, sharing resources, and discussing logistics. They can also be used synchronously with voice chats, allowing us to work together while discussing our assignments and tasks. 

All correspondence will be done with the professor in person or through email. We can communicate via email as long as the rest of the team is CC’d on the conversation. 

## **Meeting Schedule and Coordination** {#meeting-schedule-and-coordination}

5:45 pm \- 6:30 PM | Mondays and/or Fridays  
45-minute meetings where team members can share ideas, provide updates, and delegate tasks.

To ensure all members are aware of the meetings and do not forget to do so, we will use Google Calendar and message reminders through the chosen communication methods. 

Our team will discuss the meeting changes and ensure that as many members as possible can attend. On occasion, we will have to hold a meeting while missing a member or two. In this case, we will communicate with the missing member(s) with any relevant information after the meeting. 

The preferred method of meeting is in person; however, life is unpredictable. With the use of Discord, we can hold virtual meetings through voice chat and screen sharing. This will also help us stay flexible on meeting times. 

## **Roles and Responsibilities** {#roles-and-responsibilities}

| MEMBER | ROLE |
| ----- | :---: |
| Mudit Lal | Project Monitor |
| Houyu Zhang | Meeting Leader |
| Gwen Eging | Assignment Leader |
| Sean-Michael Hall | Meeting Recorder |

Each team member will pick a role based on the amount of workload that they can tackle. If a team member feels like they need assistance on a specific project assignment, they will communicate with the rest of the team and they will do their best to assist in any way they can. In order for the group to succeed as a whole, we must all be doing our parts and contributing to the team. In addition, the team will check in with one another to make sure that we are all doing the work evenly and effectively. The team will refer to team assignments, documentation, etc in order for the team to reach its milestone and success as a whole.

Roles will change upon team members' request. We will decide who is assigned to each role based on preference. Team members will help through requests over Discord chat. We will identify and respond to situations of role adjustments by discussing them in team meetings. We will track team activities through the project monitor. We will assign technical responsibilities in class.

## **Team Coordination and Accountability** {#team-coordination-and-accountability}

We will ensure each team member checks assignments, that each team member has knowledge of what is required for each assignment, and that feedback is distributed and acted upon by sending assignments into a discord chat pre-submission, updating each other in class, and following up over discord to provide any clarifications, and assigning a member to keep track of feedbacks for us to implement.

Skill and knowledge of an assignment will be verbally distributed in person or remotely. If a team member feels that they don’t have the skill and knowledge to complete a task, the team will comprise the workload to complete the assignment by the assigned deadline.

Team members are assisted and held accountable through discord chats and a possible call if deemed necessary. Underperforming members will receive various warnings and explanations before escalation.

## **Conflict Recognition and Resolution** {#conflict-recognition-and-resolution}

Any conflicts within the group will be tackled as a group. If a team member has any sort of conflict with the group, they will voice their thoughts and concerns to the group and present what needs to be fixed. Therefore, the group will come to a compromise as a whole either in-person or remotely via one of the communication methods that has been established.
